Monday September 20 at the *Botanical Nights*.  
I discovered the excellent Brussels band **"The Brums"**.  

Contraction of **"brass" and "drums"**, **"The Brums"** is a brass band with an atypical line up that plays with styles and draws its inspiration from electronic music, abstract hip hop and avant-garde jazz. Real hyperactives, these four all-terrain musicians have become with their respective projects essential of the Belgian scene. Acoustic instruments meet electronics (analog synth, fx), energy and freedom meet groove in an original repertoire composed and arranged for three brass instruments and a drummer.  

I recommend you to go on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1UjBZhrnWGGATmhyu3HlhI) to listen to what they do !!
