We were walking on the small roads of the Ardennes and we came across this hotel/restaurant. 

Amazing is the word I would use. The building is very tasteful and the food... Everything is local... It was wonderful.  

 Don't miss it if you are passing by.  
 It is located at the **viewpoint of rochehaut**
